# Artificial-neural-network-with-keras-MNIST-dataset
This repository is about using keras neural network model with MNIST dataset
In this repository the handwritten digits MNIST dataset used and keras sequential model has been trained with that dataset. the keras model consists of 2 dense layers with 128 neurons and "relu" activation function.
