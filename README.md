# Artificial-neural-network-with-keras-MNIST-dataset
This repository is about using keras neural network model with MNIST dataset
In this repository the handwritten digits MNIST dataset used and keras sequential model has been trained with that dataset. the keras model consists of 2 dense layers with 128 neurons and "relu" activation function.
The output layer of the model consists of 10 neurons as the number of expected output is also 10. and "softmax" is used as an activation function for the output layer.
